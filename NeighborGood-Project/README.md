Users can read details about articles and can navigate through various articles across pages(using Pagination) within same news category. 

**Key Features:**

* Pagination: Users can navigate through various pages of news articles using buttons(Next and Prev) to go Forward and Backward.
* Filtering: Users can filter news based on the category they would like to read.
* Detailed View*: Every news article can be read in detail, giving users a more comprehensive detailing.
* Error Handling: Errors including but not limited to API fetch/network are handled which makes overall web app work smooth.
